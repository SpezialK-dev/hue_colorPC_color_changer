# The Goal of this pice of software

to play around a bit with philips hue Api and take a closer look and test some things out without looking at the documentation at first.

THIS REQUIRES YOU TO OWN A HUE BRIDGE !!
## to play around with your own 
https://discovery.meethue.com/ this gets the ip address of your hue bridge.

http://<YOUR HUB IP>/debug/clip.html this is where you can use the API debugger
## What I found so far

- The webserver being used is nginx
- its being run on a linux server
- large parts of the software are outdated
